#Instructions
```
2.2.1 :001 > require './lib/random'
 => true
2.2.1 :002 > t = Random.new
 => #<Random:0x007fe101a0c488>
2.2.1 :003 > t.generate

 ##improvements

 a few things i can add are..
 •put random numbers in order
 •add a puts to say here are your numbers
 •allow a user to select a range of number like i only want numbers between (5, 41) ect..
